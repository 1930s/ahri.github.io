I'm trying my hardest to get back to using these dwarves as practice: they're
supposed to be imperfect playgrounds with which I can learn some nice techniques
to use on my more impressive models.

I've managed to test out some weathering techniques along with using inks to
provide depth, before getting completely bored with this model and I'm fairly
happy with the results, even with the obvious mistakes and deficiencies in the
quality of my work.
