After a break of a few years I suddenly felt like painting again, mostly to calm
my mind and focus for a while. I'd forgotten quite how meditative it is!
Unfortunately I'm rather out of practise and lacking in confidence. I spent most
of my time considering how much impact that confidence has on my performance
across the board, making little mistakes here and there and dwelling on them
pointlessly. A microcosm of my psyche.

It's clear how much of a waste of effort scrutinising those mistakes is, yet
it's nigh-on impossible to push this behaviour away. After an hour or so I'd
decorated a shield, eventually letting the mistakes subside, and gaining
confidence to take broader, more clear strokes. I'd like to think I learnt
lessons from this but in reality, without that practise these revelations won't
stick.
