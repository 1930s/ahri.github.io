Since being on holiday I've felt a renewed interest in writing and have decided
to try and write once a day; small or large, I'd just like to build that habit.

I'm not going to push myself too hard; but I'll adopt the [Seinfeld Method](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret)
and see where it takes me.
