The first [LibGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/)/[RoboVM](http://www.robovm.org/) powered app is [on the app store](http://www.badlogicgames.com/wordpress/?p=3193). This is really great news for indie game developers who don't have the cash to shell out for [Xamarian](http://xamarin.com/) in order to deploy to iOS.

It's a really exciting time for developers looking to write-once-deploy-everywhere as this enabled games written in Java using LibGDX to be deployed to the desktop, HTML5, Android and now (stable soon!) iOS.
