I've been struggling along for a while seeing whether I can bear the pain of employing Test Driven Development with my Views (I went for an MVC architecture for my app for simplicity) and I've gotten to the point where I'm just going to remove all the unit testing on them; it's so brittle (as foreseen by everyone else).

The point of this post isn't to express surprise, it's to admit defeat and move on, perhaps revisiting UI testing when I have more time to properly dedicate myself to it.

To be fair it really pushed me to create a decent architecture and did a great job of highlighting where my architectural decisions were poor, but it's now feeling like cleaning it up would make rewriting my tests so arduous that I'm put off, and that should never be the case! Definitely time for them to die :)
