			 	<h1>When to stop caring?</h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Mon, Feb 10, 2014</span>
			      <p>I received some bad news about an estranged friend before I went on holiday and
my first reaction was really &ldquo;should I even care?&rdquo;, see; the estrangement was
pretty mutual and was the result of what I see as profound differences in our
respective approaches to friendship.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to dig all that up, having spent a long time getting to grips with
it and accepting that some relationships just don&rsquo;t work. It really took a long
time to stop thinking about my friend and feeling hurt about what had happened.</p>

<p>So back on topic; I had this bad news and it stirred all these feelings up, and
my defensive reaction was simply that I shouldn&rsquo;t care: so I&rsquo;d try not to. I had
a good holiday but I did dwell on it in-between having fun: am I really being
honest with myself here? Can I really just ignore this bad thing that&rsquo;s
happened? Let&rsquo;s bear in mind here; the bad thing is completely not his fault so
it feels completely unjust to mix that up with the things for which I do hold
him accountable; those actions and inactions that led up to the split.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t managed to find an answer within myself to the question I&rsquo;ve asked; I
can&rsquo;t switch my feelings on and off, and I can&rsquo;t stop caring or wanting to help
even if I (cynically) feel that I&rsquo;ll end up disappointed that he&rsquo;s not
magically become a friend I want to have. So I&rsquo;ll help where I can and I&rsquo;ll
hope anyway. I can&rsquo;t see any other way that works for me.</p>
