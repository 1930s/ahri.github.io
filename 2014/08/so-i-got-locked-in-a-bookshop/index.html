<p>I began browsing the sci-fi section, looking for trashy stuff mostly, like Harry<br>
Harrison. Having exhausted the obvious stuff I noticed a sign saying “more sci-fi<br>
in the back!” so I obeyed the call and found big piles of sci-fi to trawl.<br>
Heaven!</p>
<p>I should highlight at this point that this bookshop was described by my sister as<br>
"the one that plays loud music out onto the street" and indeed it was blasting<br>
out jazz this evening - a pleasant and quite endearing habit of theirs, but one<br>
that turned out to be my downfall.</p>
<p>I continued to browse the books and amassed infinitely more in my I’ll-probably-<br>
buy-this-stuff pile than I had expected (i.e. my expectation was for zero since<br>
I already have plenty of unread books to plough through!) There’s some great<br>
stuff there; from Harry Harrison to Heinlein to LeGuin, and even a Star Trek<br>
book which I’m pretty dubious about, but hey it’s about Romulans so it’s gotta<br>
be good, right?!</p>
<p>I eventually decided that the pile was big enough and that I should probably get<br>
out before I bought half the shop.</p>
<p>I looked around. Nobody. Called “HELLO?!” a few times. Nothing. I analysed the<br>
situation; the music was still on, as were the lights, there was an uneaten<br>
salad of some variety prepped and ready to dig into. Cool. They must be around<br>
somewhere.</p>
<p>I tried a couple of doors; one went downstairs and one up. It felt rather like<br>
a mixture of a horror film and one of those old text-based adventures:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You reach the stairwell: do you want to go [U]p or [D]own?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I opted for Down: Up looked dark :(</p>
<p>In the basement there were a few things; a broken ladder, a couple of locked<br>
toilets, and then more stuff, detritus mostly. Not worth listing in a<br>
text-adventure.</p>
<p>Ok, so there’s nobody here. I’ll leave the hard-won pile of books near the till<br>
and come back tomorrow. No big deal!</p>
<p>Oh shit. The door is locked. I’m stuck in someone else’s shop and I’m alone and<br>
I have no food except someone else’s salad and when did I last use the toilet<br>
and will I survive the night?!?! Perhaps panicking wasn’t going to be so<br>
helpful: deep breath.</p>
<p>More investigation of the situation was needed: surely I was being a simpleton<br>
and there was actually a way to open this locked door. Nope. Sealed. Not a yale<br>
lock. Well then - let’s think logically about this - there must be spare keys?<br>
Found precisely <em>one</em> that looked promising. Didn’t fit. My heart sank.</p>
<p>Ok, phone numbers then - there must be a mobile scribbled down somewhere! Rescue<br>
is a phone call away! Nope. Ok, think laterally. Visit their website in search<br>
of a number… nope, only a landline for the shop… try it anyway in the vain<br>
hope that it’s forwarding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RING RING</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, that didn’t work. Tricky.</p>
<p>Around this time, and noting the security camera I decided it might be prudent<br>
to call the police, hopefully demonstrating that I wasn’t involved in the heist<br>
of a bookshop. I quickly got through, apologised in an extremely English manner<br>
for wasting everyone’s time, and explained the situation, at which point I must<br>
have been allocated the very lowest priority possible and stuck in a phone<br>
queue being repeatedly informed that more important emergencies were going on<br>
and to stop being a big baby. Well, that’s what I read into it anyway.</p>
<h2 id="know-your-enemy">Know your enemy</h2>
<p>Exploration was the way forward, it seemed, with no official attention (but<br>
holding on for the police to pick up) I ventured forth. Up I went. More<br>
shouting: “HELLO?! ANYONE THERE?!” thinking &lt;I’m going to die&gt;. Seems<br>
overly dramatic, but read on! Coulda happened!</p>
<p>Floors of books, and knick-knacks, and less books as I went up: top floor was<br>
largely empty - another ladder, not so broken looking, and jackpot! FIRE EXIT!</p>
<p>Unfortunately the damn thing wouldn’t open - the push-bar thing was stuck and I<br>
couldn’t urge it open, so I gave it a sharp kick and smelt the fresh air!<br>
I felt like Mel Gibson leading the charge against the<br>
melodramatically-and-largely-misrepresented English in Braveheart. FREEDOM!</p>
<p>Turns out it was open about 2 inches and now it was stuck. Really stuck. I<br>
booted it a couple more times for good measure but it didn’t shift and I was<br>
worried about breaking stuff. I decided to use the old lift-and-apply-pressure<br>
technique. Cue sound of rotten wood giving way. Oops. Broke the top hinge. On<br>
the plus side I could now get out, which I did, and then nipped back in and<br>
down to the till to write a letter of apology.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>You locked me in your shop! I tried calling you but couldn’t find your mobile.<br>
I searched for a spare key to no avail.</p>
<p>I found a fire escape door at the top floor and pushed hard to open it, but<br>
the wood was rotten and the top hinge broke! I’m sorry!</p>
<p>I’ve been trying to call the police for 20mins but they put my on hold so I’ll<br>
try the fire escape.</p>
<p>I’ll pop in tomorrow to buy the books! [arrow drawn here to the treasure-trove<br>
of discovered books - my main concern at this point was genuinely that they<br>
might re-file my treasure-trove!]</p>
<p>-Adam</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Back up I went, out onto the fire escape which I discovered was really rusty and<br>
a lot higher up than I’d hoped… I don’t really like heights! At this point the<br>
police picked up and I apologised profusely and gave a short summary of events<br>
culminating in my position at the top of a dodgy fire-escape, the door for which<br>
I left ajar just in case I needed it - possibly the most sensible thing I’ve<br>
ever done!</p>
<p>The nice bloke on the end of the line suggested that if I felt safe I should try<br>
using the fire escape, and I didn’t want to seem too pathetic, having already<br>
been locked in a shop by mistake, and gave it a whirl. The first step was solid<br>
and I gained enough confidence to stride onto the next - which immediately<br>
loosened and gave way on one side. This was a sobering moment indeed. Shit was<br>
definitely real.</p>
<p>Not willing to let such trivialities as death-by-fall-and-impaling get in the<br>
way of a good escape I proceeded carefully down until I got to the first floor<br>
which had had its escape ladder chained up and padlocked. The padlock looked<br>
stronger than the entire set of stairs put together. I considered a heroic jump<br>
to the floor but the nice man on the line suggested that this was perhaps not<br>
the best idea.</p>
<p>He left me alone at that point for us both to regroup: he had to try to contact<br>
the owners, and I had to re-climb the steps-of-little-integrity and wait for<br>
rescue in the shop. It was out of my hands now - kinda reassuring in a pathetic<br>
sort of way. I welcomed opportunity to use two hands now that I wasn’t holding<br>
my phone and ascended, breaking bits off here and there and trying to retain my<br>
sanity whilst considering my ridiculous death. Thankfully the door was still<br>
open when I reached the top - I had already resigned to the inevitability that<br>
it would’ve swung shut in the minimal wind so this was a positive development.</p>
<p>I resolved to wait, and have a read whilst I was there - may as well make use of<br>
the perks available, right? After a few pages I got fed up waiting and called<br>
the police back with my incident number and had a good laugh about my situation<br>
with the very nice lady on the line - one should always appreciate one’s<br>
ridiculous misfortunes.</p>
<p>They had the foresight to enquire as to how much battery I had remaining: 33%<br>
but I pointed out that I was manning the phones in the bookshop this evening so<br>
if they needed me I was pretty available!</p>
<p>They had had no luck contacting the owner and were sending someone over.<br>
Confused at what this someone might be able to achieve, and not welcoming the<br>
spectacle of a fire-engine rescue, I went back to reading.</p>
<p>The police turned up and suggested that I could get back down the fire-escape<br>
and they could bring a ladder, but by this point I’d decided a couple of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wasn’t sure the fire escape would be charitable enough to stay up for a<br>
redux</li>
<li>This was going to take a while anyway, so why rush things?</li>
</ul>
<p>We began discussing the fire brigade again and my heart sank. I could picture a<br>
fireman triumphantly carrying me over his manly shoulder - the pathetic wretch<br>
he supported not even able to escape a mere bookshop.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey, this is my shop!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God finally got bored of torturing me for cheap laughs. The owner was back!<br>
One-and-a-half hours after leaving me to my doom. He’d gone for a coffee, and<br>
this was the one time in 30 years running the shop that he hadn’t shouted “FIRE<br>
DRILL! EVERYONE OUT!” before locking up. I was just relieved that not too much<br>
fuss had been made, and was of course very apologetic about the door.</p>
<p>I’ll be back tomorrow to buy that pile of books - they don’t take card, as it<br>
turns out.</p>
