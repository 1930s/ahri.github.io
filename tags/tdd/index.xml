      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling along for a while seeing whether I can bear the pain of employing Test Driven Development with my Views (I went for an MVC architecture for my app for simplicity) and I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten to the point where I&amp;rsquo;m just going to remove all the unit testing on them; it&amp;rsquo;s so brittle (as foreseen by everyone else).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of this post isn&amp;rsquo;t to express surprise, it&amp;rsquo;s to admit defeat and move on, perhaps revisiting UI testing when I have more time to properly dedicate myself to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair it really pushed me to create a decent architecture and did a great job of highlighting where my architectural decisions were poor, but it&amp;rsquo;s now feeling like cleaning it up would make rewriting my tests so arduous that I&amp;rsquo;m put off, and that should never be the case! Definitely time for them to die :)&lt;/p&gt;
