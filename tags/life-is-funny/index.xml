      <title>So I got locked in a bookshop</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I began browsing the sci-fi section, looking for trashy stuff mostly, like Harry
Harrison. Having exhausted the obvious stuff I noticed a sign saying &amp;ldquo;more sci-fi
in the back!&amp;rdquo; so I obeyed the call and found big piles of sci-fi to trawl.
Heaven!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should highlight at this point that this bookshop was described by my sister as
&amp;ldquo;the one that plays loud music out onto the street&amp;rdquo; and indeed it was blasting
out jazz this evening - a pleasant and quite endearing habit of theirs, but one
that turned out to be my downfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued to browse the books and amassed infinitely more in my I&amp;rsquo;ll-probably-
buy-this-stuff pile than I had expected (i.e. my expectation was for zero since
I already have plenty of unread books to plough through!) There&amp;rsquo;s some great
stuff there; from Harry Harrison to Heinlein to LeGuin, and even a Star Trek
book which I&amp;rsquo;m pretty dubious about, but hey it&amp;rsquo;s about Romulans so it&amp;rsquo;s gotta
be good, right?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eventually decided that the pile was big enough and that I should probably get
out before I bought half the shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked around. Nobody. Called &amp;ldquo;HELLO?!&amp;rdquo; a few times. Nothing. I analysed the
situation; the music was still on, as were the lights, there was an uneaten
salad of some variety prepped and ready to dig into. Cool. They must be around
somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried a couple of doors; one went downstairs and one up. It felt rather like
a mixture of a horror film and one of those old text-based adventures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You reach the stairwell: do you want to go [U]p or [D]own?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opted for Down: Up looked dark :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the basement there were a few things; a broken ladder, a couple of locked
toilets, and then more stuff, detritus mostly. Not worth listing in a
text-adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so there&amp;rsquo;s nobody here. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave the hard-won pile of books near the till
and come back tomorrow. No big deal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh shit. The door is locked. I&amp;rsquo;m stuck in someone else&amp;rsquo;s shop and I&amp;rsquo;m alone and
I have no food except someone else&amp;rsquo;s salad and when did I last use the toilet
and will I survive the night?!?! Perhaps panicking wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be so
helpful: deep breath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More investigation of the situation was needed: surely I was being a simpleton
and there was actually a way to open this locked door. Nope. Sealed. Not a yale
lock. Well then - let&amp;rsquo;s think logically about this - there must be spare keys?
Found precisely &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; that looked promising. Didn&amp;rsquo;t fit. My heart sank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, phone numbers then - there must be a mobile scribbled down somewhere! Rescue
is a phone call away! Nope. Ok, think laterally. Visit their website in search
of a number&amp;hellip; nope, only a landline for the shop&amp;hellip; try it anyway in the vain
hope that it&amp;rsquo;s forwarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RING RING&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, that didn&amp;rsquo;t work. Tricky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around this time, and noting the security camera I decided it might be prudent
to call the police, hopefully demonstrating that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t involved in the heist
of a bookshop. I quickly got through, apologised in an extremely English manner
for wasting everyone&amp;rsquo;s time, and explained the situation, at which point I must
have been allocated the very lowest priority possible and stuck in a phone
queue being repeatedly informed that more important emergencies were going on
and to stop being a big baby. Well, that&amp;rsquo;s what I read into it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;know-your-enemy:fe40e36e17e5b65bbd1e8b9fb1c83adb&#34;&gt;Know your enemy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploration was the way forward, it seemed, with no official attention (but
holding on for the police to pick up) I ventured forth. Up I went. More
shouting: &amp;ldquo;HELLO?! ANYONE THERE?!&amp;rdquo; thinking &amp;lt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to die&amp;gt;. Seems
overly dramatic, but read on! Coulda happened!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Floors of books, and knick-knacks, and less books as I went up: top floor was
largely empty - another ladder, not so broken looking, and jackpot! FIRE EXIT!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the damn thing wouldn&amp;rsquo;t open - the push-bar thing was stuck and I
couldn&amp;rsquo;t urge it open, so I gave it a sharp kick and smelt the fresh air!
I felt like Mel Gibson leading the charge against the
melodramatically-and-largely-misrepresented English in Braveheart. FREEDOM!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out it was open about 2 inches and now it was stuck. Really stuck. I
booted it a couple more times for good measure but it didn&amp;rsquo;t shift and I was
worried about breaking stuff. I decided to use the old lift-and-apply-pressure
technique. Cue sound of rotten wood giving way. Oops. Broke the top hinge. On
the plus side I could now get out, which I did, and then nipped back in and
down to the till to write a letter of apology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You locked me in your shop! I tried calling you but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find your mobile.
I searched for a spare key to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found a fire escape door at the top floor and pushed hard to open it, but
the wood was rotten and the top hinge broke! I&amp;rsquo;m sorry!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to call the police for 20mins but they put my on hold so I&amp;rsquo;ll
try the fire escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll pop in tomorrow to buy the books! [arrow drawn here to the treasure-trove
of discovered books - my main concern at this point was genuinely that they
might re-file my treasure-trove!]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Adam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back up I went, out onto the fire escape which I discovered was really rusty and
a lot higher up than I&amp;rsquo;d hoped&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t really like heights! At this point the
police picked up and I apologised profusely and gave a short summary of events
culminating in my position at the top of a dodgy fire-escape, the door for which
I left ajar just in case I needed it - possibly the most sensible thing I&amp;rsquo;ve
ever done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nice bloke on the end of the line suggested that if I felt safe I should try
using the fire escape, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to seem too pathetic, having already
been locked in a shop by mistake, and gave it a whirl. The first step was solid
and I gained enough confidence to stride onto the next - which immediately
loosened and gave way on one side. This was a sobering moment indeed. Shit was
definitely real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not willing to let such trivialities as death-by-fall-and-impaling get in the
way of a good escape I proceeded carefully down until I got to the first floor
which had had its escape ladder chained up and padlocked. The padlock looked
stronger than the entire set of stairs put together. I considered a heroic jump
to the floor but the nice man on the line suggested that this was perhaps not
the best idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He left me alone at that point for us both to regroup: he had to try to contact
the owners, and I had to re-climb the steps-of-little-integrity and wait for
rescue in the shop. It was out of my hands now - kinda reassuring in a pathetic
sort of way. I welcomed opportunity to use two hands now that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t holding
my phone and ascended, breaking bits off here and there and trying to retain my
sanity whilst considering my ridiculous death. Thankfully the door was still
open when I reached the top - I had already resigned to the inevitability that
it would&amp;rsquo;ve swung shut in the minimal wind so this was a positive development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I resolved to wait, and have a read whilst I was there - may as well make use of
the perks available, right? After a few pages I got fed up waiting and called
the police back with my incident number and had a good laugh about my situation
with the very nice lady on the line - one should always appreciate one&amp;rsquo;s
ridiculous misfortunes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had the foresight to enquire as to how much battery I had remaining: 33%
but I pointed out that I was manning the phones in the bookshop this evening so
if they needed me I was pretty available!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had had no luck contacting the owner and were sending someone over.
Confused at what this someone might be able to achieve, and not welcoming the
spectacle of a fire-engine rescue, I went back to reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police turned up and suggested that I could get back down the fire-escape
and they could bring a ladder, but by this point I&amp;rsquo;d decided a couple of things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure the fire escape would be charitable enough to stay up for a
redux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was going to take a while anyway, so why rush things?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We began discussing the fire brigade again and my heart sank. I could picture a
fireman triumphantly carrying me over his manly shoulder - the pathetic wretch
he supported not even able to escape a mere bookshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, this is my shop!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God finally got bored of torturing me for cheap laughs. The owner was back!
One-and-a-half hours after leaving me to my doom. He&amp;rsquo;d gone for a coffee, and
this was the one time in 30 years running the shop that he hadn&amp;rsquo;t shouted &amp;ldquo;FIRE
DRILL! EVERYONE OUT!&amp;rdquo; before locking up. I was just relieved that not too much
fuss had been made, and was of course very apologetic about the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be back tomorrow to buy that pile of books - they don&amp;rsquo;t take card, as it
turns out.&lt;/p&gt;
